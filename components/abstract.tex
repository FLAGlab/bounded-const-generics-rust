Rust is a language aiming to provide a way to write robust and performant code without using garbage collection nor manual memory managment. Yet it lacks of a mechanism to abstract constants from code when well established languages such as C++ have one. In order to provide such a mechanism, we have developed an symbolic execution engine for the Rust compiler and explored its integration in the trait solving and type inference mechanisms of the compiler.
