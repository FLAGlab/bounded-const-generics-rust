abstract="Ownership types were devised nearly 15 years ago to provide a stronger notion of protection to object-oriented programming languages. Rather than simply protecting the fields of an object from external access, ownership types protect also the objects stored in the fields, thereby enabling an object to claim (exclusive) ownership of and access to other objects. Furthermore, this notion is statically enforced by now-standard type-checking techniques.",
